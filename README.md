## Project Overview

We designed a sailing game in Godot using GDScript, then 

## How to Play

- The objective of the game is to keep your hunger bar up for as long as possible, if not, then the game is over
- Rippling areas of water mean there's an opportunity to catch a fish
- Three kinds of fish - regular, clownfish, and shark
- You are able to eat these fish to keep your hunger bar up, each fish replenishes more health than the last
- Tia is able to give you fun facts about the vast open sea and its diverse marine life!
